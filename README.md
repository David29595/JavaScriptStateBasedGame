# StateBasedGameJS

StateBasedGameJS is a simple framework to create state based games in javascript. This project was inspired from a college assignment where I had to create a game in javascript, but I couldn't find any simple example of state based games in javascript, which was all I needed at the time.

This framework provides a main file `game.js` which handles all the logic for creating and managing the game states and for the rendering and updating of the game logic.

Any number of game states can be added to the game and as long as they implement the required functions from Game.js they will work with the game.
